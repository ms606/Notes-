1. Codebase:
   A codebase is any single repo (in a centralized revision control system like
   Subversion), or any set of repos who share a root commit (in a decentralized
   revision control system like Git).

   Note: If there are multiple codebases, it’s not an app – it’s a distributed
   system. Each component in a distributed system is an app, and each can
   individually comply with twelve-factor.

   Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor.
   The solution here is to factor shared code into libraries which can be
   included through the dependency manager.

3. Config:
    Woh sari variations between deploys mai hongi (staging, production, dev env. etc).
      * Resource handling to the database, memcached & other backing services.
      * Credentials to external services such as Amazon s3 or twitter etc.
      * Per-deploy values such as the hostname for deployment.

4. Backing services:
    Isme woh sari services ati hain jo app use kerti hai over the network communication
    as a normal operation. E.g. datastores (such as MySQL or CouchDB),
    messaging/queueing systems (such as RabbitMQ or Beanstalkd),
    SMTP services for outbound email (such as Postfix), and caching systems
    (such as Memcached).

    When we deploy and 12 factor app we can change the backend from on db to another
    eg. MySQL to Amazon or local SMTP server can be swapped with a third party
    SMTP service, without any changes to the app's code.

    Each distinct backing service is a resource, if a two MySQL db ( for sharding
    at the application layer) they will be count as two distinct resources.
