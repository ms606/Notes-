HASH TABLE IN ORACLE: A hash table is a table where you can store stuff by the
use of a key. It is like an array but stores things differently.
E.g.
  ~ a('CanBeVarchar') := 1; -- A hash table

Hash joins are used when joining the large tables ya when the join requires the
maximum joined table rows.

Algo for oracle hash join

* There are two tables involved.
    1."SMALL TABLE IS CALLED BUILD TABLE.
    2.LARGER TABLE IS CALLED PROBE TABLE."

1. The optimizer uses smaller of the 2 tables to build a hash table inside the
memory.

    Build phase:
      For each row in small table loop
      Calculate hash value on join key
      Insert row in appropriate hash bucket.
      End loop;

2. Then scans the large tables and compares the hash value (rows from the large table)
with this hash table to find the joined rows.

    Probe Phase:
      For each row in big table loop
      Calculate the hash value on join key
      Probe the hash table for hash value
      If match found
      Return rows
      End loop;



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost of the hash Join =
  Cost of the read of table A +
  cost of the read table B +
  some little processing in memory
