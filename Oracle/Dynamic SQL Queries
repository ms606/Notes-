DYNAMIC SQL:
 It enables you to write programs jo reference SQL statements, jis ki sari cheezein runtime tk pata nhe hoti.
 Few example:
  1. Data warehousing application where we know the tables later.
  2. Sorting clauses.
  3. Applications that query a database where the data definition of the tables
  are constantly changing.
  4. Applications where the new tables are often created.

Use EXECUTE IMMEDIATE syntax to run the query in DYNAMIC SQL STATEMENTS.

Example in the article which was used was something like this:

The database in this scenario is a company's human resources database (named hr) with the following data model:

A master table named offices contains the list of all company locations. The offices table has the following definition:

Column Name          Null?          Type
LOCATION             NOT_NULL       VARCHAR2(200)

Multiple emp_location tables contain the employee information, where location is
the name of city where the office is located. For example, a table named emp_houston
contains employee information for the company's Houston office, while a table named emp_boston
contains employee information for the company's Boston office.

Each emp_location table has the following definition:

Column Name          Null?          Type
EMPNO                NOT_NULL       NUMBER(4)
ENAME                NOT_NULL       VARCHAR2(10)
JOB                  NOT_NULL       VARCHAR2(9)
SAL                  NOT_NULL       NUMBER(7,2)
DEPTNO               NOT_NULL       NUMBER(2)

TYPES OF POSSIBLE WAYS TO USE THE PL/SQL PACKAGES.
1. Native Dynamic SQL, lets us use dynamic sql directly in pl/sql code. These includes
   DML statements, PL/SQL Blocks, DDL statements, transaction control and session
   control statements.
