              APPLICATION LEVEL WORKFLOW

Step 1: Define requirements and standards.
    a. Naming conventions and coding standards.
    b. How to write and where to write SQL statements in PL.
    c. Error management.

Step 2: Build the application foundation.
    a. Formalize a process that supports the rules to be followed.
    b. Automate the implementation of rules. 
RULES ARE ABOVE MENTIONS IN STEP 1.

Step 3: Build the application iterations.
    Build small individual working programs.

Step 4: Validate the application iterations.
    a. Successful applications meets user requirements.
      Regression tests for the code and QA.
    b. Successful applications are maintainable.
      Check coding standards, combine peer reviews.
    c. Check the performance of entire application.

Depending on the source of the problem, we must then go back and “do it again.”

             SINGLE-PROGRAM CONSTRUCTIION WORKFLOW
How to write an individual program, procedure or a function.

Summary first:
1. Prepare for program construction.
2. Build an iteration of the program.
3. Test the program iteration.
4. Trace the execution of the program.
5. Debug the program.
6. Validate the program: optimize and review.
