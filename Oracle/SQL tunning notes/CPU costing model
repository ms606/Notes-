ccording to the CPU costing model:

Cost =  (#SRds * sreadtim +
         #MRds * mreadtim +
         #CPUCycles / cpuspeed ) / sreadtim

where:

    #SRDs is the number of single block reads
    #MRDs is the number of multi block reads
    #CPUCycles is the number of CPU Cycles *)
    sreadtim is the single block read time
    mreadtim is the multi block read time
    cpuspeed is the CPU cycles per second

CPUCycles includes CPU cost of query processing (pure CPU cost) and CPU cost of
data retrieval (CPU cost of the buffer cache get).

This model is straightforward for serial execution. For parallel execution,
necessary adjustments are made while computing estimates for #SRD, #MRD, and
#CPUCycles.
